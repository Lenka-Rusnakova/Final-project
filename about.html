  <div class="header">THE STORY OF KINDRED SPIRITS</div>

  <div class="story">
  <p> We are a family business originally from Prince Edward’s Island in Canada. In 2015 we bought Green Gables, an old farm house near the Lake of Shining Waters in northern Italy and opened an almost self-sustainable, ecollogical retreat centre for lovers of creative writing.</p> 


  <p>Our secluded location with views of the magnificent Italian Alps is the perfect place to tap into your creative sources. With Anne’s gentle guidance you will be able to explore  the power of your imagination.</p>

       <div class="ANNE"> <b>ANNE SHIRLEY - CREATIVE WRITING TUTOR</b> <br></div>
          <div id="annetext">
        <p>Anne was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia and moved to Avonlea to live with Marilla and Matthew when she was 11 years old.<br>  
        She won a scholarship to Redmond College, in Kingsport, Nova Scotia. While working as a principal at the Summerside School, Anne taught English and creative writing for 10 years. In 2015 she decided to open her own school of creative writing and moved to Italy to start Kindred Spirits.<br>
        For Anne, all things are alive -  she imagines trees by the roadside welcoming her to Green Gables, and a leaning plum tree makes her think that it is offering a veil just for her.<br>  
        Anne has great powers of imagination, fed by books of poetry and romance, and a passion for romantic and beautiful  names and places.

      <p>Marilla’s life pasion is cooking nourishing and delicious meals. Since moving to Italy she has been exploring local ingredients and traditional recipes. Most of the vegetables and fruit, together with eggs and milk are Green Gable‘s own produce.<br>
      Marilla also makes sure that Gren Gables are always ready for visitors, and leads a team of housekeepers to take care of the retreatants’ comfort.</p>

        <p>Matthew spends most of his time outdoors, taking care of the extensive land surrounding Green Gables. Recently he set up a chicken coop supplying Green Gables with their own free-range and cruelty- free eggs.
        His garden suplies Green Gables with all sorts of organically grown fruit and vegetables. <br> 
        Matthew loves long walks by the Lake of Shining Waters and breathtaking Italian sunsets. </p>
